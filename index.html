      <h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>What is Machine Learning? A definition</h2>
      
        Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems 
        the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
      <strong>Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs </strong> that can access data and use it 
        learn for themselves.
      <br><br>
        The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, 
        or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future 
        based on the examples that we provide.<strong> The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically </strong>
        without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
      
        <br><br>
      <h3> Some machine learning methods</h3>
        Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.
      <ul><br>
        <li><strong>Supervised machine learning algorithms </strong>can apply what has been learned in the past to new 
          data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known 
          training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions
          about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after 
          sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, 
          intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.</li><br>
        <li>In contrast,<strong> unsupervised machine learning algorithms </strong>are used when the information used to 
          train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can 
          infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure
          out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to 
          describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms</strong> fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning,
          since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of 
          labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able
            to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when 
            the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it /
            learn from it. Otherwise, acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional 
            resources.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement machine learning algorithms</strong> is a learning method that interacts with its
                environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search 
                and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This 
                method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior 
                within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is 
                required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement 
                signal.</li><br>

    <h2>In a nutshell..</h2>
    <p>Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster,
    more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may
    also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with 
    AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of 
    information.
